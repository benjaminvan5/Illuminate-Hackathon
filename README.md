# Illuminate-Hackathon - MyMedMate
This is a medical application designed to help people keep track of their medicine. Users can input their medicine and their recommended dosage and track it over time.
The medicine input is stored as a string and the dosage input accepts integers.
Different types of dosages can be selected.
The medicine-dosage pair is then stored in a dictionary to use in the daily tracker.
